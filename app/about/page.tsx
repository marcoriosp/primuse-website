          <p className="mb-4">You should read this Policy so you can understand what type of cookies we use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding accepting or declining the use of cookies.

          <p className="mt-7"><strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</strong></p>
          <p className="mb-4">Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer or mobile device downloads when you visit a website. When you return to websites – or visit websites that use the same cookies – they recognise these cookies and therefore your browsing device.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Like most banks, we use cookies to do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. They can also help ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. We also use similar technologies such as pixel tags and JavaScript to undertake these tasks.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">If you visit our website, we will deploy these technologies to provide an online service more suited to the device you connect from, as well as to prevent and detect fraud, keeping you secure. When you visit our website from any device (mobile, tablet or PC), we collect information about your use of this site, such as information about the device or browser you use to access the site (including device type, operating system, screen resolution etc.), the way you interact with this site, and the IP address your device connects from. You may not be able to initiate or complete some activities within our secure online services unless these cookies or similar technologies are installed. Please note, we may not be able to process certain transactions if you are physically located in certain countries.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">We use cookies to:</p>
          <ul className="mb-4 list-disc ml-10">
            <li>Ensure your security and privacy when in our secure sites</li>
            <li>Store login details for our secure sites</li>
            <li>Temporarily store input information in our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations</li>
            <li>Provide you with ads that are more relevant to you and your interests, and improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites and partner sites</li>
            <li>Improve our understanding of how you navigate through our sites so we can identify improvements</li>
            <li>Evaluate our sites’ advertising and promotional effectiveness (we own the anonymous data collected and don’t share it with anyone); and</li>
            <li>We use both our own (first-party) and partner companies’ (third-party) cookies to support these activities</li>
          </ul>
         
          <p className="mt-7"><strong>COOKIES IN EMAILS</strong></p>
          <p className="mb-4">In addition to the cookies we use on this website, we also use cookies and similar technologies in some emails and push notifications. These help us to understand whether you have opened the email and how you have interacted with it. If you have enabled images, cookies may be set on your computer or mobile device. Cookies will also be set if you click on any link within the email.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">The word cookie is often used as a general term to describe a number of technologies, all of which have a similar purpose. This page explains a little bit more about the types of cookies we use in emails and the choices you have in terms of accepting or rejecting them.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">We use cookies in some of our emails. They help us to understand a little bit about how you interact with our emails, and are used to improve our future email communications.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">If you have configured your computer to automatically display images, or if you have added us to your email &quot;address book&quot; (or &quot;safe senders&quot; list), or if you have configured your computer to have &quot;weak&quot; security, cookies might be set at the same time as you download, open or read an email from us. If you would prefer for this not to happen, you should disable the automatic displaying of images, or remove us from your address book or strengthen your security settings.</p>

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>1. The types of ‘cookies’ we use:</strong></p>
            <div className="prose mx-5">
              <p className="mt-4"><strong>Web beacons</strong></p>
              <p className="mb-4">A web beacon is a tiny, invisible image placed within an email message that tells us whether you have opened an email, how often you have opened it, how you interacted with the email (such as the time you spent reading the email), which email software and web browser you used, which device you used and your IP address. We also use web beacons to help us display emails in the best format for your device.</p>
              
              <p className="mt-4"><strong>Link tracking</strong></p>
              <p className="mb-4">Our emails contain a number of hyperlinks, each of which has a unique tag. When you click on one of these links you will be automatically redirected to the server of our mailing company which logs the click. From there you will be redirected to the relevant page on our website. This process enables us to understand who has clicked through from an email to visit our website. We use this information to tailor future messages to you.</p>
              
              <p className="mt-4"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
              <p className="mb-4">Our process for delivering emails may cause cookies to be set, when you download images or when you click on a link.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div className="prose mx-5">
            <p className="mt-7"><strong>2. Making choices about cookies</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-4">If you do not wish to accept cookies from any one of our emails, simply close the email before downloading any images or clicking on any links. You can also set your browser to restrict cookies or to reject them entirely. These settings will apply to all cookies whether included on websites or in emails.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">In some instances, depending on your email or browser settings, cookies in an email may be automatically accepted (for example, when you’ve added an email address to your address book or safe senders list). Please refer to your email browser or device instructions for more information on this.</p>

          <p className="mt-7"><strong>COOKIE CATEGORIES</strong></p>
          <p className="mb-4">The type of cookie used on this website can be put into 1 of 4 categories, based on the International Chamber of Commerce guide to cookie categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality &amp; Profile and Targeting.</p>

            <p className="mt-7"><strong>1. Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies are essential, as they ensure your security and privacy when you use our secure sites, as well as enabling you to move around a website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you’ve asked for (such as access to secure areas) can’t be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet.</p>

            <p className="mt-7"><strong>2. Performance Cookies</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-4">In most cases, the information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how a website works and to help us to identify issues you may have when using our online services. In limited cases for online banking issues, these cookies enable us to identify specific issues you may have had.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising. Without these cookies we can’t learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Examples:</p>
            <ul className="mb-4 list-disc ml-10">

            <p className="mt-7"><strong>3. Functionality &amp; Profile Cookies</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language or the region you’re in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember login details, changes you’ve made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you’ve asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies may be used to ensure that all our services and communications are relevant to you. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you’ve previously made or personalise your browsing experience.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Examples:</p>
            <ul className="mb-4 list-disc ml-10">
              <li>mbox</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p className="mt-7"><strong>4. Targeting Cookies</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies and similar technologies gather information about your browsing habits. They remember that you’ve visited a website and share this information with other organisations, such as advertisers and platforms on which we advertise. They do this in order to provide you with ads that are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">Our emails may contain a &quot;web beacon&quot; (or &quot;tracking pixel&quot;) to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email.</p>
